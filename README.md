# Hello there! My name is Good, Filipe Good  😎😎
 
 I'm a Software Developer currently working as a Data Engineer. My main passion is Data Science and Machine Learning. And that is what I mainly post in github!
 Despite working as a Data Engineer, my goal is to work in projects related to Data Science and Machine Learning. In the meantime, while I don't work in that area, I try to learn and master the skills needed to be a great Data Scientist. I.e, to be a **Good** Data Scientist 😎
